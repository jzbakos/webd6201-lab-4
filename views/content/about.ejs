        Hi there, I'm <b>Josh Bakos</b>. I've been developing websites &
        applications since I was 14 years old.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I was young I was fascinated with programming in general and now,
        the more I learn, the more my fascination grows. What started out as a
        hobby has now become my dream career path.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have about 3 years of development experience through Durham College,
        as well as 1 year experience developing intelligent and autonomous
        business solutions at Durham College's AI HUB.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the course of my educational journey I have gained considerable
        experience with the following programming tools:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>And more...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Application development is not only an interest of mine, but something I
        would consider a passion. I enjoy being given a problem and working
        towards a solution. I look foward to taking on new challenges as they
        come.
